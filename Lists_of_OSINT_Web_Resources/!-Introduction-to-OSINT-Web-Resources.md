Oh look, its *yet another* list of OSINT resources..

Since I do mainly do OSINT work for a living, you can imagine that I have accumulated a huge amount of resources and tools to assist me in locating certain information about certain things over the years. Figured I should share them in a mostly organized fashion, because sharing is caring right?

The below lists are currently still a work in progress! It was going to take ages to write so I've decided to just publish what I already have and continue to push updates on the live versions. So stay tuned for more.

Here is an organized and importable .html file of all resources included from all sections.
